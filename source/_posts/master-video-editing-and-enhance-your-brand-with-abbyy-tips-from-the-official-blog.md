## Video Editing Apps, Creating a Business Card, and Monitoring Sleep

April 29, 2019

![](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26793/mobile-monday-77.jpg) 

The video apps on our list can‚Äôt exactly help make A-list movies but will still be useful for easier editing tasks. We‚Äôll also tell you how to create a business card in BCR and show you a sleep control app.

## **Video Editing Apps for iPhone and Android**

**iMovie**

Apple just wouldn‚Äôt be Apple without their own cool free video editing app. If you‚Äôre not keen on having to figure out all of the features in [Final Cut](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/), then [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id377298193) should be more than enough for creating short clips, videos, and even simple movies. [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id377298193) lets you:

* work with videos in 4K,
* apply visual filters,
* use your favorite iTunes tracks,
* apply templates that will set the right mood,
* insert text and pretty scene transitions,
* share the videos you‚Äôve made.

And, of course, you can cut and paste sequences and do various other edits.

![how to edit video on a smartphone](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26796/imovie3.jpeg)

You can keep working on your video on any iOS or Mac device that has [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id377298193) installed thanks to the magic of iCloud! üòâ

[You can download iMovie from the App Store here.](https://itunes.apple.com/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8)

**Magisto**

How about a video editor with built-in AI? The best feature of the [Magisto](http://www.magisto.com/) editing app is that it can put together a complete video clip using your best photos and videos, which it selects automatically.

![magisto app for editing videos on a smartphone](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26797/magico.png)

Other than that, it also lets you:

* add music from your iPhone and iPad libraries, as well as use built-in tracks,
* use built-in templates and effects,
* share your videos on various social networks directly from the app,
* use it on your iPhone or iPad via iCloud.

You can download Magisto [for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id486781045) or [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magisto).

**GoPro‚Äôs Quik**

This is a video editor from [GoPro, a leading action-cam maker](http://gopro.com/). However, you don‚Äôt need to have one of their cameras to be able to use the app. [Quik](https://quik.gopro.com/) lets you create colorful videos about events like a seaside vacation or a mountain climbing trip in just a few taps: you upload your files, the app analyzes them and selects the best, syncs the video with your soundtrack, and you‚Äôre done! Of course, the feature list doesn‚Äôt end there. You also can:

* slow down and speed up your video,
* use geolocations,
* overlay text, titles, and emoji over your video,
* import music from DropBox, GoogleDrive, iCloud Drive, and Box in almost any format, including FLAC, MOV, AIFF, and ALAC.

![gopro quik video editor](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26800/gopro.png)

You can download the app [here for iOS](https://quik.gopro.com/dl/ios/?ct=hp) or [here for Android](https://quik.gopro.com/dl/android/?ct=hp).

**Movavi Clips**

This app has earned itself the nickname of ‚ÄúiMovie for Android.‚Äù It‚Äôs convenient, simple, and stylish.

![movavi video editor for android](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26803/movavi.png)

Here‚Äôs just a few things you can do with Movavi Clips:

* frame-by-frame editing with an easy-to-use timescale,
* cutting and deleting your video clips,
* adjusting the brightness of the video,
* adjusting the saturation of your clips to give them more color,
* automatically adding scaling and panoramic effects to your photos,
* cutting and editing soundtracks.

![movavi app for android](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26804/movavi2.png)

Movavi Clips is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movavi.mobile.movaviclips&hl=ru) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1226251139).

By the way, you obviously need to record some videos before you can start editing them! üôÇ [Here](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) you can find some tips on how to shoot videos like a pro.

## **ABBYY Tip: Creating Your Own Card with Business Card Reader for iOS**

Collecting your business partners‚Äô contacts is an important task, but it‚Äôs a two-way street: they need your contact details as well. We would advise you to take two minutes of your time to create your own business card with [Business Card Reader](https://go.onelink.me/LuYz/ca107d7), which you would then be able to share in one tap.

First, you can simply scan your existing business card and send the scan to the My Business Cards folder. If you don‚Äôt have a card handy, you can just create one in [Business Card Reader](https://go.onelink.me/LuYz/ca107d7). Here‚Äôs how.

In the main menu, open **Settings** by tapping the gear icon in the top right corner, and then go to the **Create your business card** section.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Fill out all the necessary fields. If you want to place your company‚Äôs logo on the card as well, take a photo of a colleague‚Äôs card or on any other document bearing your company‚Äôs logo. Tap the magic wand icon at the bottom of the screen, and BCR will crop away everything except the company logo.

## **App of the Week: Pillow Sleep Tracker**

If you are suffering from insomnia even after a long and tiring day of work, there might be an endless list of causes: stress, having looked at a flickering monitor all day, a constant stream of phone calls at work, and so on.

The [Pillow](https://neybox.com/pillow-sleep-tracker-en) app can help you by tracking your sleep patterns.

It has a wide range of features, including the ability to synchronize with the iPhone‚Äôs Health app and special algorithms to analyze your sleep. The app analyzes your phases of sleep and creates a report. You can even record your wake-up mood to help [Pillow](https://neybox.com/pillow-sleep-tracker-en) create a more customized sleep schedule.
