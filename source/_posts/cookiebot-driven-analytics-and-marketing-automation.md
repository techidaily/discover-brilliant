#### _The new-to-market SDK uses AI-enabled mobile tech to create a seamless beginning to a customer journey._

ABBYY, a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today launched ABBYY Mobile Web Capture, a new SDK enabling developers to add real-time image and data capture to their mobile web-based onboarding scenarios. Suitable for iOS and Android, the SDK will help companies to dramatically accelerate onboarding processes, decrease client dropout rates caused by manual data entry, and create a better customer experience.

Today mobile is the preferred channel of engagement for customers seeking services, accounts, or applications. However, they are normally hesitant to download a native application prior to becoming an official customer. Therefore, the company’s website opened in a mobile Internet browser becomes the main onboarding channel. Businesses are trying to reduce the high dropout rates by removing existing barriers like downloading an app and implementing technologies enabling self-service. ABBYY’s new Mobile Web Capture meets both of these needs as it adds mobile capture capabilities supporting the self-service experience to the company’s web pages, without the extra step of downloading a mobile app.

The engagement and experience expectations in the future will revolve around immediacy and simplicity, according to [Digital Banking Report 2018](https://www.digitalbankingreport.com/ "Digital Banking Report 2018"). The stakes are especially high in banking and finance: [Accenture estimates](https://www.accenture.com/in-en/~/media/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Industries%5F5/Accenture-2014-NA-Consumer-Digital-Banking-Survey.pdf) that 35% of revenues will be at risk by 2020 due to disruption. Mobile Web Capture speeds up onboarding by allowing the potential client to instantly take photos of documents needed for account opening making sure the image is suitable for text recognition. The new SDK uses a web browser on the mobile device to capture high-quality images in real time helping to complete registration processes. As soon as the user points the camera at a document, the technology automatically captures the best possible quality image in the live video stream eliminating the risk of errors and increasing the accuracy of the captured data in the backend.

“With ABBYY Mobile Web Capture, we aim to help organizations to deliver a smooth customer experience, boost profits, and differentiate on the market throughout the whole customer journey. The new devkit closes the gap in mobile onboarding for enterprises providing the same experience as a native app, without the need to install one. With its zero-footprint architecture and easy integration, Mobile Web Capture is a perfect solution to reach the growing population of digital-first and digital-only clients and secure your market share,” comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.

The new devkit is based on ABBYY’s proprietary suite of AI-enabled mobile technologies for instant and accurate data and image capture. The JavaScript-based SDK automatically captures a high-quality image through the web browser as soon as the user points the mobile device at a document and ensures it is suitable for recognition. It also allows optimizing the company’s development resources enabling mobile capture to be included into the existing mobile web architecture.
