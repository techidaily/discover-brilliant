“It is impossible to adequately express in a few words our gratitude to Dean for his leadership, vision, companionship and wisdom. Throughout the last twenty years, he has been ABBYY through and through and for me it has been a pleasure and privilege to work closely with Dean over the past couple of years. Dean’s contribution to making ABBYY what we are today can’t be overestimated,” said ABBYY CEO Ulf Persson.
