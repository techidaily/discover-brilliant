ABBYY FlexiCapture

###### RESULTS

* 60% reduction in the manual work
* Cutting operating costs and optimizing the workflow

Relemar Despachante is a private Brazilian company with more than 30 years of experience in the market of outsourcing vehicle documents management. They work together with the national transport department (DETRAN) throughout the country to provide a wide range of both B2B and B2C services. The company has to deal with a lot of paperwork connected with receiving or renewing driving licenses, managing traffic fines, licensing vehicles or including them into the National Register of Freight Vehicles, as well as many other tasks. Relemar Despachante promotes a highly personalized client-oriented approach, which eventually results in the loyalty of their customers, including well-known companies and prominent personalities.

#### Challenge

The company is committed to continuously improving its business processes in order to cater to the needs of its existing and potential clients, which is why they use a state-of-theart information management system. All the account data on clients’ fleets - such as fines or information on vehicles and drivers - are aggregated in their own custom collaboration tool “Techdesp”. This system gives the clients an opportunity to view reports and other relevant information online whenever necessary.

However, since most of the documents are still received in paper form (traffic fines, licenses and other vehicle documents), all the data from them have to be inserted into the system first, which until recently was done manually.

In order to raise productivity, reduce operating costs and cut down input errors that inevitably occurred during manual entry, Relemar Despachante decided to automate its documents input and started looking for a software solution.

#### Solution

 After a thorough market research, Relemar Despachante made their choice in favor of the software presented by Macrosolution, the leading supplier of systems for conversion of paper into digital files, including both software and hardware solutions, and ABBYY longstanding Partner in Brazil. Macrosolution suggested ABBYY FlexiCapture emphasizingthe software’s ease of use and a wide range of customization options for importing and exporting documents. These features proved to be the decisive factor in favor of the solution, as later stated by the client.

So here is how ABBYY FlexiCapture is incorporated into the workflow. On a daily basis, Relemar Despachante receives documents by e-mail or in paper form, then the paper ones are scanned and sent to the same Hot Folder as the ones that were sent by email. From the folder the documents are automatically imported into the ABBYY FlexiCapture system for processing.

Using specially created templates, the software recognizes and extracts necessary information from the images. Recognized information is validated against an SQL database using various scripts and rules, which guarantees the accuracy of at least 96%. Then the resulting output files are saved under the name of one of the fields so as to be later easily located in the Relemar Despachante custom-made document management system. The client can access the system online and view the documents by clicking on a link. All the important data are saved in their turn in the SQL database. Thus, information becomes available to the company’s clients, which simplifies reporting and decision-making.

 “My relationship with ABBYY is still at an early stage, but at the moment what especially stands out is the efficiency of their software, and the great support service through ABBYY Partner in Brazil - Macrosoluton. I believe that in the future we will have more opportunities for growth in addition to a better knowledge of the character recognition system.”

 Thiago Baptista, Operations Manager

#### Results

The deployment of ABBYY FlexiCapture took up 4 months, followed by 2 more months of adjusting templates and adding new ones. Thanks to the automation of the documents’ input, Relemar Despachante has already reduced manual work by 60%, and this figure is expected to move beyond 80% with the inclusion of new templates. Meanwhile other staff can concentrate on customer service and developing new commercial strategies.

One of the important things for the project is that ABBYY FlexiCapture is very versatile, and it is possible to habilitate new functions and workflows using a number of customization options available in the system. Moreover, the software allows exporting data to practically any ERP system, including custom solutions - such as Relemar Despachante’s “Techdesp” tool.

As a result, Relemar Despachante can already see the positive effect of implementing ABBYY FlexiCapture. The company has managed to gain productivity and reduce operational costs, thus achieving their main goal and making communication with their clients easier and more effective.
