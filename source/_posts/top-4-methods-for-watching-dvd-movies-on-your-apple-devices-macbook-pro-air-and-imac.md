## Method 4\. How to Play DVD on Mac with Remote Disc?

Remote Disc is a Mac feature that allows one Mac to share and access another Mac's DVD/CD drive as if it was their own. That is to say, you can insert a DVD into a drive on one Mac, and watch the DVD on another Mac over the network.

Also, Remote Disc allows these Macs without optical drives to achieve many other great functions, such as installing software from DVDs, importing CDs into iTunes, ripping DVDs, and even burning CDs and DVDs. However, Remote Disc doesn't allow users to play audio CDs or copy-protected DVDs on Mac. Now, let's see how to open a DVD on Mac via Remote Disc:

**Step 1:** On a Mac with the built-in SuperDrive, open "System Preferences".

**Step 2:** Click on "Sharing", then choose the lock icon.

**Step 3:** Enter your admin password, tick DVD Sharing. This feature is only available on a Mac with an optical drive. 

**Step 4:** Insert a DVD into the drive and the user on another Mac will be able to watch the DVD.

However, this way requires two Macs connected over a network. So, it may not be suitable for you if you only have one Mac.

This method requires **two computers running at the same time** when you watch DVD movies on MacBook Pro or Air, iMac or Mac mini. Besides, internet access is also required to share the DVD movie. So remote disc can be very slow over the network. Besides, not all types of DVDs are supported. You **can't play protected DVDs on Mac** this way.

### 1\. Why can't I play a DVD on my Mac?

The biggest cause of DVDs not playing on Macs is that Apple has abandoned the DVD drive on its Macs, so it is impossible to insert a DVD disc and open it. In addition to that, many other factors will also contribute to the not playing problem. For example, there is dirt and dust on the disc, which causes Mac to eject DVDs. The Mac DVD player can't play DVDs after the Mac OS upgrade or when the DVD disc is damaged. Furthermore, region-locked DVDs cannot be played on your DVD player.

### 2\. How do I view a DVD on my Mac?

There are two primary methods for opening a DVD on a MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or Mac mini: You can directly play DVDs on a Mac with a DVD player. But you should note that some DVD players can't play region-locked DVDs and blu-ray discs. Ripping DVD discs to DVD media files is another popular method for watching DVDs on Mac. 

### 3\. How can I play a DVD on my Mac without a DVD drive?

Actually, all DVD disc playback needs a DVD drive. But if you have a DVD media file like VIDEO\_TS folder or ISO Image, you can directly play DVD on Mac with a DVD player without the need of DVD drive.

### 4\. What to do when DVD drive won't read disc?

Some other times, the DVD drive won't read any DVD and will eject the disc automatically. When the DVD drive is not working, it is usually a sign that the disc is not readable or the drive has an issue. Now you can try to:

* Try another DVD disc, if the problem occurs with a specific DVD, the disc may be damaged or dirty. You can try to repair the scratched DVD and try again.
* If the problem continues on every disc, there may be an issue with the hard drive. You can clean the lens of the optical drive with a cleaning disk, or purge the slot with compressed air.
