_Thanks to ABBYY FlexiCapture changing your energy supplier to Butagaz takes less than three minutes_

ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligence services, announced today that Butagaz, a French multi-energy group, has successfully integrated FlexiCapture technology to enable people to switch energy supplier quickly and simply by using photo captures of their old bills.

Butagaz was looking for a technology to make it easier to sign up for its natural gas and electricity supply from a mobile phone, directly on butagaz.fr. ABBYY FlexiCapture was chosen for its simplicity of implementation, flexibility and ease of use. The contract between Butagaz and ABBYY was signed in March 2017 and the solution was deployed in mid-November, alongside advertising campaigns to publicise Butagaz’s new natural gas and electricity supply business.

Butagaz decided to provide a simple and effective process to help with this. Indeed, Butagaz promises to change a person’s energy supplier in less than three minutes, simply by using a photo of their natural gas or electricity bill. After logging in to the Butagaz website from a smartphone, the user sends the photo of their bill to ABBYY FlexiCapture, which identifies whether it is a gas or electricity bill and recognises the point of delivery (meter ID). Smart recognition is responsible for processing and categorising this data, which is then sent back to [Butagaz.fr](https://www.butagaz.fr/ "Butagaz")to obtain a price estimate. To finalise the switch, the user just needs to sign their contract online.

“We worked on the design of our new website to ensure it would provide the best possible user experience, especially on a mobile phone. With an eye to making it more user-friendly, we met up with the people from ABBYY,” explains Damien Duchaussoy, Director of Marketing for Natural Gas and Electricity, Butagaz. “The ABBYY solution convinced us due to its ease of implementation and flexibility. With ABBYY FlexiCapture, Butagaz now enables consumers to switch supplier in less than three minutes, with no obligation, no interruption to their supply and no involvement from any third party. More and more people are trusting us to supply them with natural gas and electricity and our goal is to attract more than a million new customers by 2022.”

“Thanks to its smart recognition and data processing capabilities, the ABBYY FlexiCapture solution immediately positioned itself as the ideal technological partner for this project,” says Nicolas Bertrand, Head of France Enterprise Sales. “We are delighted to have the opportunity to support Butagaz’s initiative, which now offers an innovative and user-friendly way for consumers to switch energy supplier.”
