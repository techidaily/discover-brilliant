[ABBYY Business Card Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id898215947) is redefining business contact management with its biggest update yet.

In addition to a substantial iOS update, we are proud and excited to introduce the new Apple Watch application for our multifunctional business card and contact manager. The application works smoothly across platforms giving you the freedom to access information and connect using any device.

“_You don’t even need your iPhone anymore to stay in touch. Now you have all your business contacts on your wrist – in the BCR app on your Apple Watch. You can find the information you need and make a call straight away. Easy to access, easy to navigate, easy to use. BCR does all the work for you, saving your time for more important things_”, says ABBYY Vice President and Head of Mobile Artem Kumpel.

The unique, exceptionally accurate autocorrect algorithm is among the key features of the new ABBYY BCR. The application automatically fixes telephone numbers and addresses, so that you don’t have to think about it when you need to connect. With telephone numbers, ABBYY BCR finds and deletes any unnecessary symbols, adds international and area codes, and recognizes extensions. For example, thanks to the algorithm, the captured number (408)\*457-97\]77 transforms into its correct, usable version +1 408 457 9777 momentarily. If the number has an extension, the application saves it in a format that allows you to call the generic number first and then dial the extension, just by pushing a button on the screen of Phone app. When it comes to addresses, the new BCR independently adds Index, Region, Area and other missing information.

Another new time-saving feature is the two-way contact synchronization between the application and the iPhone Contacts. For the contacts saved both in the BCR app and on your iPhone, all the changes synchronize no matter where they are made.

In addition to that, the app now has an automatic backup system to guarantee the 100% safety of your business cards. As a bonus, now you can find your digitized contacts using Spotlight search from the iPhone home screen without opening the app.

As a result, through enhanced accuracy and strengthened safety, a new level of efficiency has been achieved. The new ABBYY Business Card Reader takes on business contact management for you to achieve your goals faster.
