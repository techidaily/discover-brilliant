There’s no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) is talked about everywhere. From the launch of ChatGPT to software robots replacing jobs, the high volume of recent media attention has been creating both excitement and confusion among business leaders.

There’s fear of being left behind, worries about jumping in too quickly, and concerns about investing in the wrong technologies. Which path should you be taking?

ABBYY is here to help. We’ve decided to dedicate the entire month of September to explaining how AI is being used to automate business processes and guide successful intelligent automation.

### Welcome to Intelligent Automation Month

We’ve joined forces with other industry influencers and advocates to highlight how AI solutions such as intelligent document processing (IDP), robotic process automation (RPA), process intelligence, and generative AI are putting your information to work, so you can achieve operational excellence and accelerate business outcomes.

You’ll gain market insights that will help you focus your digital transformation initiatives, learn how to make a business case for C-suite buy-in, and get tips for championing workforce adoption. Additionally, innovation leaders who are currently spearheading transformation within their companies will candidly share their best practices and lessons learned. These are online sessions that you won’t want to miss.
