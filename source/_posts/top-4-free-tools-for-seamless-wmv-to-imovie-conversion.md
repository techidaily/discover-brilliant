<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The last one I want to recommend is an online MOV video editor—Fastreel. You can edit videos without having to download anything. It offers built-in templates, so you can edit videos with those templates or via online tools. But the free version only results in low quality video limited to 480p. If you want to remove the watermark and get high-quality video content, you can pay for the single-premium or unlimited premium.

**Official website:**[https://www.fastreel.com/](https://www.fastreel.com/)

**Pros:**

* Straightforward to use
* A set of templates to choose

**Cons:**

* Free-version offers limited capabilities and have watermarks
* Can’t call a support agent
