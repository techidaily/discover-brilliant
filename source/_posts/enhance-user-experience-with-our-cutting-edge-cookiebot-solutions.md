#### _Will Demonstrate Digital Intelligence Solutions that Influence the Future of Work_ 

  
Global organizations wanting to successfully deploy and gain quantifiable results from AI in the enterprise can meet with [ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) during [AI World 2019](https://aiworld.com/ "AI World 2019") in Boston October 23-25, where it will showcase its latest Digital Intelligence (IQ) solutions at booth 216.

Additionally, ABBYY AI evangelist, Ivan Yamshchikov, will speak about the shift in the future of work that puts an emphasis on people’s soft skills, such as critical thinking, cognitive flexibility and emotional intelligence, with AI technologies during a session titled, “Augmenting Human Intelligence for the Future of Work.” The session takes place October 25 at 3:25 p.m. ET.

According to the [Center for Data Innovation](https://www.datainnovation.org/2019/08/who-is-winning-the-ai-race-china-the-eu-or-the-united-states/?mod=article%5Finline "Center of Data Innovation"), the United States leads the world in AI development and its adoption is estimated to create $13 trillion of gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 2030\. Business executives and technologists attending AI World want help cutting through the hype of AI and learning where it can make a business impact. ABBYY believes that the critical intelligence of the enterprise is locked in unstructured content and helps to liberate meaning and intelligence trapped behind enterprise content with its Digital IQ solutions.

Digital IQ solutions are a new class of AI technologies that provide the digital workforce with the skills to understand enterprise content and processes, which leads to intelligent business decisions. It includes Process IQ, ABBYY’s platform that provides true understanding of what’s inside business processes, and Content IQ, AI technologies and solutions capable of understanding content and extracting actionable insights.

“The truth is AI has underwhelmed many organizations because digital transformation projects were shortsighted. They did not consider shortcomings of RPA, challenges with enterprise content or understand the real-world workflow of their business processes,” commented Anthony Macciola, Chief Innovation Office of ABBYY. “During AI World, we’ll illustrate how to simply identify which content-centric processes would benefit most with AI, supplement human intelligence and answer critical questions ahead of time, such as how will it monitor RPA digital workers, what process should be a candidate, what will its value be, and how much time will we really be saving.”

Media interested in meeting with ABBYY executives during AI World may schedule a briefing with Catherine Johnson at [catherine.johnson@abbyy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).
